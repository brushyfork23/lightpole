# lightpole
TWANG on a lightpole with a remote controller.  A Moteino embedded in the controller streams accelerometer data to the lightpole and receives game states back.  It displays life indication LEDs and plays audio based on state.  A Moteino powering the lightpole accepts accelerometer data from the controller, runs the game code, renders the display, and returns game state to the controller.
